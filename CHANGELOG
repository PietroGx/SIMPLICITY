	Version 0.2.0

	* refactoring decoupled core modules from managers (simulation.Simplicity has still a dependency to output_manager)
	* added runners API + 3 impementations (serial, multiproccessing, slurm)
	* added test suite (currently only for single-experiment)

	Version 0.2.1

	* commented out slurm part of fixtures to run on local machine
	* implemented test for single seeded simulation
	* added print("----------------------") before genome import for more readibility
	* fixed bug creating ghost Data folder. Data is created in working directory! Use config.set_data_dir(path) to change
	* moved create population step into simulation.py, enhancing decoupling
	* moved sequencing dataset writing function to output manager
	* fixed bug causing output path to be wrong 
	* fixed bug causing plot not to be saved 
	* moved plots to plots_manager
	* renamed output variable names for more consistency
    * renamed variant_inf_count (in population) to lineage_frequency
 	* moved all the output files writing responsibilities to output_manager
    * implemented plotting from saved data files 
    * tested and debugged new plot
    * updated simulation class
    * fixed naming in output manager.save_sequencing_dataset
    * fixed bug causing dataset for regression to be saved wrongly
    * added genome decoder
   	* fixed bugs on infection tree - now it works again
   	* infection tree does not store the full sequence anymore but one can get it from individuals_data.csv
   	* Wrote test for infection tree
   	* updated nexus tree export function
    * Wrote test for phylogenetic tree
   	* updated phylogenetic tree function (now tree built from phylogenetic_data.csv)
   	* updated simulation.run for verbose output
   	* fixed import bug in phylogenetic_data that caused an error in the tree building
   	* fixed fasta file writing - now is written correctly
   	* fixed genome decoder - now all mutations are introduced in the reference genome when decoding
   	* implemented tree-builder module (updating old infection tree and phylogenetic tree files)
    * created tests for trees
   	* fixed variable name conflict causing bug in tree rendering
   	* created and tested new runme for local machines

2025-01-24 pietro gerletti

	Version 0.2.2

	* updated setup.py and yml env file
	* updated and corrected imports paths
	* updated runme.py to have consistent signatures wuth tests
	* added exception handling in output_manager.setup_output_directory
	* added exception handling in settings_manager.read_settings_and_write_simulation_parameters
	* implemented and tested complete test for local code serial runner
	* implemented and tested complete test for local code multiprocessing runner
	
2025-01-29 pietro gerletti

	Version 0.2.3
	
	* wrote test for HPC_runme
	* updated config with MAX_PARALLEL_SIMULATIONS env variables
	* updated multiproccessing runner env MAX_PARALLEL_SIMULATIONS name
	* updated test for HPC_runme
	* updated slurm runner to accomodate new unit_run signature
	* new tests and runners  work

2025-04-02 pietro gerletti

	Version 0.3.0
	
	* updated info for users on test_local_runme
	* testing parameter space for e/u regression - created test file 
	* sklearn added to dependencies
	* changed value of runtime_max in settings manager (3600)
    * added exception handling to config.get_output_directory
    * added exception handling to config.get_simulation_parameters_dir	
    * updated standard values dictionary and fixed parameter names conflicts
    * rewrote and updated tempest regression funcs and plots 
    * moved tempest regression plots to plot_manager
    * added script to extract plots to Data/00_Tempest_regression_plots
    * updated test_parameter_space - now parameter space exploration routine running locally
    * created script explore_u_parameter_space
	
2025-05-02 pietro gerletti

	Version 0.3.1
	
	* updated plot manager to use Agg instead of Qt for slurm plotting
	* found bug that causes simulation plots to be created also when plot set to False (on HPC)
