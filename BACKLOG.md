## Backlog

### Bug Fixes
- [ ] memory and runtime options need to be added to slurm runner to avoid Runtime and OOM errors

### Features
- [ ] 

### Technical Debt
- [ ] plot_trajectory should be passed to runners with partial function (not changing the function's signature)
- [ ] memory and runtime requests to slurm hardcoded into runner
- [ ] function in dir_manager to list all simulation output folders (hardcoded into check_simulations.py)
